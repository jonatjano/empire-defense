# Texture packs

## Folder format
Your texture packs images must be placed in the folder `assets/images/<texture pack name>` \
You can then copy the folder structure in the default texture packs to serve as a base


```
|
|- entities
| |- buildings
| |- projectiles
| |- units
|- icons
|- maps 
```

## Animations
Animation are made using vertical bands, all the state of the animation are in the same image, the engine then gets the one it needs at runtime

## pack.json
Each texture pack must come with a `pack.json` \
This file contains metadata about your texture pack, it must be a valid [json file](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_Object_Notation).

The json object found in the file follows the same structure as the directory structure, the root of the object being the root folder of the texture pack
```json
{
    "entities": {
        "buildings": "...",
        "projectiles": "...",
        "units": "..."
    }
}
```
When setting a property, it will apply automatically to all the subfolders recursively

### properties
Valid properties are :

| property name         | description                                                                                                           | expected value |

| pixelHeight           | The Height of the image in pixel (when doing animation you must specify the height of one state)                      | number         |
| pixelSize             | Define both `pixelWidth` and `pixelHeight` in a single rule                                                           | number         |
| worldWidth            | The width of the unit when drawn in the game, expressed in cell                                                       | number         |

| animations            | Give details about the entity animations                                                                              | Animation[]    |

#### textureType details
`textureType` can take one the following values :
- `"IMAGE"`: Used for icons and maps, when this value is used `animationFrameDuration` is the only other property not ignored
- `"BASE_ONLY"`: Used for units that can't rotate, when using this value the folder should only contain an image named `base`
- `"ROTATION_ONLY"`: Used for units whose texture is totally dependent on their rotation, when using this value, the folder should contain one image per valid angle as defined by `angleBetweenRotations` and `isSymmetric` (view [rotation](#rotation))
- `"ROTATION_AND_BASE"`: Used for units with both a static part and a rotation dependant part, must have both a `base` image and one image per valid angle (view [rotation](#rotation))

Properties order has no impact

#### rotation
When creating a unit which can rotate, you have to create one image per rotation and name it with the angle in degree of the rotation. \
For the image names, the angles start to the bottom goes anticlockwise : 0° is bottom, 90° is right, 180° is top and 270° is left.

i.e. if your unit can rotate by angles of `45°` then you need to have `0.png`, `45.png`, `90.png`, `135.png` and `180.png` \
if you set the property `isSymetric` to false for that unit, you also need to create `225.png`, `270.png` and `315.png` \
there is no need for 360° because it is equivalent to 0°

#### animation details
An Animation is an object, here are the properties of these objects

| property name | description                                                                                                               | expected value |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| name          | The name of the animation                                                                                                 | string         |
| timings       | An array containing the time of each frame in millisecond                                                                 | number[]       |
| fixedStart    | Whether the animation frame is decided based on the global time (`true`) or the time when the animation was set (`false`) | boolean        |


### Default values :
These are the values used when you do not define them in your `pack.json`, defining a value will override it.

```json
{
	"extension": "png",
	"angleBetweenRotations": 90,
	"isSymmetric": true,
	"textureType": "IMAGE",
	"pixelSize": 128,
	"worldSize": 1,
	"animations": {
		"idle": {
			"timings": [
				1000
			],
			"fixedStart": true
		}
	},
	"entities": {
		"textureType": "ROTATION_ONLY",
		"buildings": {
			"textureType": "ROTATION_AND_BASE",
			"pixelHeight": 256,
			"worldHeight": 2
		},
		"projectiles": {
			"angleBetweenRotations": 15,
			"animationFrameDuration": 500
		}
	}
}
```
If these values are the one you want to use, you can set your own `pack.json` content to : 
```json
{}
```
